         It develops when your pancreas doesn't make enough insulin or any at all, or when your 
         body isn't responding to the effects of insulin properly. Diabetes affects people of all ages. 
         Most forms of diabetes are chronic (lifelong), and all forms are manageable with medications 
         and/or lifestyle changes.\n\n Glucose (sugar) mainly comes from carbohydrates in your food and drinks. It's your body's go-to 
         source of energy. Your blood carries glucose to all your body's cells to use for energy. When 
         glucose is in your bloodstream, it needs help ‚Äî a ‚Äúkey‚Äù ‚Äî to reach its final destination. This 
         key is insulin (a hormone). If your pancreas isn't making enough insulin or your body isn't 
         using it properly, glucose builds up in your bloodstream, causing high blood sugar (hyperglycemia).\n\nOver time, 
         having consistently high blood glucose can cause health problems, such as heart disease, 
         nerve damage and eye issues. The technical name for diabetes is diabetes mellitus. Another condition

         mainly results from insulin resistance. Insulin resistance happens when cells in your muscles, fat and liver don't respond as they 
         should to insulin. Several factors and conditions contribute to varying degrees of insulin resistance, including obesity, lack of 
         physical activity, diet, hormonal imbalances, genetics and certain medications.\n\n 2. Autoimmune disease: Type 1 diabetes and LADA happen 
         when your immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in your pancreas.\n\n 3. Hormonal imbalances: During pregnancy, the placenta 
         releases hormones that cause insulin resistance. You may develop gestational diabetes if your pancreas can't produce enough insulin 
         to overcome the insulin resistance. Other hormone-related conditions like acromegaly and Cushing syndrome can also cause Type 2 
         diabetes.\n\n 4. Pancreatic damage: Physical damage to your pancreas ‚Äî from a condition, surgery or injury ‚Äî can impact its ability to 
         make insulin, resulting in Type 3c diabetes.\n\n 5. Genetic mutations: Certain genetic mutations can cause MODY and neonatal diabetes.\n\n Long-term use of certain medications can also lead to Type 2 diabetes, including HIV/AIDS medications and corticosteroids.
